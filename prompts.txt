the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
she sells seashells by the seashore
how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
a watched pot never boils
you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take
to be or not to be that is the question
in flanders fields the poppies blow
not all those who wander are lost
life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're gonna get
the best way to predict your future is to create it
it always seems impossible until it's done
the only way to do great work is to love what you do
be the change you wish to see in the world
the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing
we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them
the unexamined life is not worth living
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
there is no substitute for hard work
if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough
don't let yesterday take up too much of today
success is not final failure is not fatal it's the courage to continue that counts
if opportunity doesn't knock build a door
if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together
if you want to lift yourself up lift up someone else
the best revenge is massive success
what you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals
